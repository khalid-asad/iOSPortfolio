# iOSPortfolio
My Portfolio app remade in native iOS Swift

## NOTE:
This uses my PlatformCommon library which is a library that houses basic functions that can be reused in every single application I make.
This requires Carthage - simply use "carthage update --use-ssh --platform iOS" command in the terminal in the directory to download the latest version of PlatformCommon.
